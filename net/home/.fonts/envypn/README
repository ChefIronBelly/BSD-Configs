			Envypn font by Ypnose -- http://ywstd.fr/

DESCRIPTION
===========

	Strange name, isn't it?

	Envypn is a pcf font inspired by Envy Code R. I wanted to have a highly
	readable PCF font. I started this font from scratch!
	It's called Envypn because it's a mix of Envy and Ypnose.
		[Env][ypn]
		  |    |
		  |    +--> Ypnose
		  +-------> Envy
	Many symbols are redrawed and improved, IMHO. I didn't copy letters from
	Envy Code R. envypn-font uses MirOS licence[1]. This licence is perfect
	for my work/needs.

	Why a README?

	This is just a little README which aims to learn you, how to use the font.

USAGE
=====

	First, you need to "enable" the font. You can add these lignes in your
	.xinitrc:

		xset +fp /usr/share/fonts/envypn
		xset fp rehash

	If the font isn't installed in '/usr/share/fonts/envypn', modify it
	accordingly.
	Restart X and now you can preview the font with xfontsel[2] or xfd[3].
	The best way to include this font, is to use XLFD standard[4].

	The full syntax is:

		-ypn-envypn-Medium-R-Normal--15-150-75-75-C-90-ISO8859-1

	You can use the following syntax in your .Xresources / .Xdefaults or
	programs you use:

		-*-envypn-Medium-R-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-1
			or
		-*-envypn-Medium-R-*-*-15-*-*-*-*-*-ISO8859-2

	For now, you can change the size: 13 or 15 and the characters encoding
	(ISO8859-1 & ISO8859-2).

	I also added aliases. If you're a lazy man, you can use the following
	syntax (for rxvt-unicode):

		URxvt*font: envypn-13

	It'll enable envypn with size 13. It replaces the previous syntaxes.
	Here the aliases:

		envypn-13 => envypn 13 size (ISO8859-1)
		envypn-15 => envypn 15 size (ISO8859-1)
		envypn.ce-13 => envypn 13 size (ISO8859-2)
		envypn.ce-15 => envypn 15 size (ISO8859-2)

	I do not recommend this syntax:

		xft:envypn:pixelsize=15

	Why? This font isn't xft. The rule is specified and you shouldn't change
	it. Even if it works, it's wrong, ugly and it causes global warming or 
	diseases.

NOTES
=====

	Even if a package doesn't exist for your favourite distribution / OS, it
	is possible to install the font, without headaches. The tarball provides
	an install script called 'envypn-install.sh'. The files won't be "seen"
	by the package manager though.

	You should NEVER use gbdfed[5], if you want to edit this font!!
	This thing (I'm not calling it a software), will corrupt or destroy the
	font, by duplicating characters. And if you even succeed to do what you
	want, you have a chance it will crashes with a "Segmentation Fault" (it
	happened to me several times, when two windows are opened).
	Save your time, and don't use this piece of crap...
	However, if you want to edit an *existing* character, it should work. Do
	it very carefully and make sure you didn't include an error (I do not
	guarantee you a valid result).

	When I totally reworked the font (around 1.5.2), I used bdfedit[6] at the
	beginning. Then, I finally decided to work with bdfctool[7] and bdfc file
	format. It's a good software. I can edit it as an ASCII file.
	Thanks to you mira!
