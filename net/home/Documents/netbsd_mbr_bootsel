Adding XXXXBSD to the NetBSD boot menu

Method 1) Use the NetBSD mbr code

Use the NetBSD mbr code which allows you to override options at boot time if required. This requires a working, bootable NetBSD installation. The NetBSD mbr code is installed in an empty file using the fdisk command in NetBSD.

In this example, NetBSD 7.0 is on disk 0 and a NetBSD Current installation is on disk 1.

devel# rm -f nbmbr
devel# touch nbmbr
devel# fdisk -BF -c mbr_bootsel ./nbmbr
fdisk: Can't read secondary GPT header: Invalid argument
Update the bootcode from /usr/mdec/mbr_ext? [n] y

Boot selector configuration:
Timeout value (0 to 3600 seconds, -1 => never): [-1..3600 default: 10] 
Select the default boot option. Options are:

0: The first active partition
1: Harddisk 0
2: Harddisk 1

Default boot option: [0..2 default: 0] 1

We haven't written the MBR back to disk yet.  This is your last chance.
Should we write new partition table? [n] y
