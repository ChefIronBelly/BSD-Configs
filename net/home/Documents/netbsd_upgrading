Let's assume you are running NetBSD/amd64 7.0 and you wish to upgrade to NetBSD 7.0.1.

# sysupgrade auto ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-7.0.1/amd64
  
Let's assume we want to upgrade installed (binary) packages.

# pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade

Let's assume we want to upgrade (source) pkgsrc up-to-date via CVS

# cd /usr/pkgsrc && cvs update -dP
