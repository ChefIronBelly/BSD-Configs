Let's assume you are running NetBSD/amd64 7.0 and you wish to upgrade to NetBSD 7.0.1.

The procedure to do so would be to run the following command:

# sysupgrade auto ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-7.0.1/amd64
  
Let's assume we want to upgrade all installed binary packages.
First install /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkgin

# pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade

Keeping pkgsrc up-to-date via CVS

$ cd /usr/pkgsrc && cvs update -dP
