Let's assume you are running NetBSD/amd64 7.0 and you wish to upgrade to NetBSD 7.0.1.
The procedure to do so would be to run the following command: ( /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/sysupgrade)

# sysupgrade auto ftp://ftp.NetBSD.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-7.0.1/amd64
  
Let's assume we want to upgrade all installed binary packages. ( /usr/pkgsrc/pkgtools/pkgin)

# pkgin update
# pkgin upgrade

Keeping pkgsrc up-to-date via CVS. (export CVSROOT="anoncvs@anoncvs.NetBSD.org:/cvsroot)

$ cd /usr/pkgsrc && cvs update -dP
