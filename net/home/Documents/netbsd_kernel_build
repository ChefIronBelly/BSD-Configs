32.3. Creating the kernel configuration file

The directories described in this section are i386 specific. Users of other architectures must substitute the appropriate directories, see the subdirectories of src/sys/arch for a list.

The kernel configuration file defines the type, the number and the characteristics of the devices supported by the kernel as well as several kernel configuration options. For the i386 port, kernel configuration files are located in the /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf directory.

Please note that the names of the kernel configuration files are historically in all uppercase, so they are easy to distinguish from other files in that directory:

$ cd /usr/src/sys/arch/i386/conf/
$ ls
CARDBUS                 GENERIC_PS2TINY         NET4501
CVS                     GENERIC_TINY            SWINGER
DELPHI                  GENERIC_VERIEXEC        SWINGER.MP
DISKLESS                INSTALL                 VIRTUALPC
GENERIC                 INSTALL.MP              files.i386
GENERIC.FAST_IPSEC      INSTALL_LAPTOP          kern.ldscript
GENERIC.MP              INSTALL_PS2             kern.ldscript.4MB
GENERIC.MPDEBUG         INSTALL_SMALL           largepages.inc
GENERIC.local           INSTALL_TINY            majors.i386
GENERIC_DIAGNOSTIC      IOPENER                 std.i386
GENERIC_ISDN            LAMB
GENERIC_LAPTOP          Makefile.i386

The easiest way to create a new file is to copy an existing one and modify it. Usually the best choice on most platforms is the GENERIC configuration, as it contains most drivers and options. In the configuration file there are comments describing the options; a more detailed description is found in the options(4) man page. So, the usual procedure is:

$ cp GENERIC MYKERNEL
$ vi MYKERNEL

The modification of a kernel configuration file basically involves three operations:

  1. support for hardware devices is included/excluded in the kernel (for example, SCSI support can be removed if it is not needed.)

  2. support for kernel features is enabled/disabled (for example, enable NFS client support, enable Linux compatibility, ...)

  3. tuning kernel parameters.

Lines beginning with “#” are comments; lines are disabled by commenting them and enabled by removing the comment character. It is better to comment lines instead of deleting them; it is always possible uncomment them later.

The output of the dmesg(8) command can be used to determine which lines can be disabled. For each line of the type:

XXX at YYY

both XXX and YYY must be active in the kernel configuration file. You'll probably have to experiment a bit before achieving a minimal configuration but on a desktop system without SCSI and PCMCIA you can halve the kernel size.

You should also examine the options in the configuration file and disable the ones that you don't need. Each option has a short comment describing it, which is normally sufficient to understand what the option does. Many options have a longer and more detailed description in the options(4) man page. While you are at it you should set correctly the options for local time on the CMOS clock. For example:

options RTC_OFFSET=-60

32.5. Building the kernel using build.sh

After creating and possibly editing the kernel config file, the manual steps of configuring the kernel, generating dependencies and recompiling can also be done using the src/build.sh script, all in one go:

$ cd /usr/src
$ ./build.sh -j 4 -U tools # fist time
$ ./build.sh -j 4 -U kernel=MYKERNEL 

This will perform the same steps as above, with one small difference: before compiling, all old object files will be removed, to start with a fresh build. This is usually overkill, and it's fine to keep the old file and only rebuild the ones whose dependencies have changed. To do this, add the -u option to build.sh:

At the end of its job, build.sh will print out the location where the new compiled kernel can be found. It can then be installed.
32.6. Installing the new kernel

Whichever method was used to produce the new kernel file, it must now be installed. The new kernel file should be copied to the root directory, after saving the previous version.

# mv /netbsd /netbsd.old
# mv netbsd /

Customization can considerably reduce the kernel's size. In the following example netbsd.old is the install kernel and netbsd is the new kernel.

-rwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  3523098 Dec 10 00:13 /netbsd
-rwxr-xr-x  3 root  wheel  7566271 Dec 10 00:13 /netbsd.old

The new kernel is activated after rebooting:

# shutdown -r now

32.7. If something went wrong

When the computer is restarted it can happen that the new kernel doesn't work as expected or even doesn't boot at all. Don't worry: if this happens, just reboot with the previously saved kernel and remove the new one (it is better to reboot “single user”):

    Reboot the machine

    Press the space bar at the boot prompt during the 5 seconds countdown

    boot:

    Type

    > boot netbsd.old -s

    Now issue the following commands to restore the previous version of the kernel:

    # fsck /
    # mount /
    # mv netbsd.old netbsd
    # reboot

This will give you back the working system you started with, and you can revise your custom kernel config file to resolve the problem. In general, it's wise to start with a GENERIC kernel first, and then make gradual changes.
