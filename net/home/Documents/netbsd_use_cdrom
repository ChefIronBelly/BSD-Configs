Using CD-RW rewritables

If you want to blank a CD-RW, you can do this with cdrecord's "blank" option:

# cdrecord dev=/dev/rcd0d blank=fast

Burning the image

If you have a CD/DVD-Writer, you can burn the iso image to a CD. For this task you need to install cdrecord, which is part of sysutils/cdrtools.

# cdrecord dev=/dev/rcd0d -data -pad -v FILENAME.iso
