Using CD-RW rewritables

You can treat a CD-RW drive like a CD-R drive (see Section 13.10, “Using a CD-R writer with data CDs”) in NetBSD, creating images with mkisofs(8) and writing them on a CD-RW medium with cdrecord(8).

If you want to blank a CD-RW, you can do this with cdrecord's "blank" option:

# cdrecord dev=/dev/rcd0d blank=fast

There are several other ways to blank the CD-RW, call cdrecord(8) with "blank=help" for a list. See the cdrecord(8) man page for more information.

Burning the image

If you have a CD/DVD-Writer, you can burn the iso image to a CD. For this task you need to install cdrecord, which is part of sysutils/cdrtools.

# cdrecord dev=/dev/rcd0d -data -pad -v FILENAME.iso
